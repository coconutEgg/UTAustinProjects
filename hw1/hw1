Project 1 is due on February 4th, 23:59 CST  or February 5th, 05:59 UTC  and You have to submit in CANVAS
You will be submitting the following three files:
reverse.zip
It should contain your solution and miscellaneous test files. (Maintain the same directory structure)
Generated binary files should not be present.
The entire folder should be 'zip'-ed, including 'tests', 'tester' and 'test - script.sh' ;
utilities.zip
Same rules as above.
A .txt file ('TestCase_Results.txt') mentioning the number of test cases succeeded for each part.
Before creating the zip archive, do 'make clean' to clean the generated binaries.
For each day a project is late, you lose 5% of the points for that project. So if you submit two days after the deadline, your maximum points on that project will be 90%.
